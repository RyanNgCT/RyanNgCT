### Hi there 👋

I'm Ryan, a Cybersecurity Student 👨🏻‍🎓 and AI enthusiast 🤖. I ❤️ teaching tech 💻.

-  I’m currently working on Coding an AI to write my reports...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
    - Blue Teaming (DFIR, Malware Analysis, Reverse Engineering)
    - Binary Exploitation (Pwn)
    - Ethics of Technology

- 🤔 I often ask myself what tasks or Security Methodologies I can automate with Machine Learning

- 🏆 I'm a Community Moderator at [Dataquest.io](https://community.dataquest.io/u/masterryan.prof/summary)

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
