### Hi there 👋

I'm Ryan, a Cybersecurity Student 👨🏻‍🎓 and AI enthusiast 🤖. I ❤️ teaching tech 💻.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
    - Blue Teaming (DFIR, Malware Analysis, Reverse Engineering)
    - Web Development and Vulnerabilities
    - Ethics of Technology

- 🤔 I often ask myself what everyday tasks or security methodologies I can automate using Machine Learning techniques.
